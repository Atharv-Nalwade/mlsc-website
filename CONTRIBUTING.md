## Contributing code
We welcome contributions from all skill levels! Here are some tips on how to contribute to our website:
1. Fork the repository. To start contributing, fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository that you can work on without affecting the original.
2. Create a new branch. Once you have forked the repository, create a new branch for your changes. This will allow you to isolate your changes from the main codebase.
3. Make your changes. Make your changes to the code, and commit them to your new branch. Be sure to add descriptive commit messages so that other contributors can understand what you have changed.
4. Push your changes. Once you are finished making your changes, push them to your fork.
5. Create a pull request. Once your changes have been pushed to your fork, create a pull request to request merging your changes into the main repository.
